No way I'm manually sending 300 emails Andrew.

Andrew is my work supervisor. He asked me to manually send 300 emails for scholarship outreach (it ended up being closer to 500 emails). I made this app instead.

Now, will I clock in the amount of time it takes me do outreach, or the amount of time it would have taken me without this app, then chill for the rest of the week?

That's one secret I'll never tell.
